    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A guided journey structure is used. The app is divided into four main sections accessible via a top navigation: Home, The 13 Principles, The Workshop (for self-analysis), and My Blueprint (a summary of user inputs). This structure logically separates the core philosophy from practical application tools, guiding the user from learning to doing. The 13 Principles section uses a sidebar for sub-navigation, allowing users to either follow the sequence or jump to a specific concept. This promotes both structured learning and flexible exploration, making the dense material more digestible and user-friendly. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. **Principles Overview**: Goal: Organize. Method: Interactive card grid. Interaction: Click to navigate. Justification: Visual, scannable entry points to complex topics. 2. **Desire Formula**: Goal: Practice. Method: Modal form. Interaction: User input generates formatted text. Justification: Turns a core book exercise into an actionable tool. 3. **Fear Diagnostic**: Goal: Diagnose/Compare. Method: Quiz feeding a Bar Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: User answers questions, chart visualizes scores. Justification: A bar chart provides an immediate, clear comparison of the user's "fears," making the abstract concept personal and measurable. 4. **Alibis List**: Goal: Organize/Inform. Method: Interactive accordion. Interaction: Click to reveal content. Justification: Manages a long list of text items, preventing cognitive overload. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

The story of Edwin C. Barnes, who "thought" his way into a partnership with Thomas Edison, perfectly illustrates this. He arrived at Edison's lab a penniless "tramp," but in his mind, he was already Edison's partner. His burning desire was the one asset he possessed, and it was enough. To harness this principle, you must transform your vague wants into a clear, definite purpose and back it with persistence until it becomes a reality.`,
